# wsdl2java-gradle-plugin

A Gradle plugin for generating Java classes from WSDL files through CXF.

## Requirements and main features

* The plugin requires Gradle 7.6 or later. (Tested with Gradle 7 and 8.)
* For using the Jakarta namespace (default), the plugin requires Java 17 or greater. For the older javax namespace, you can use Java 8, 11 or 17.
* It supports the Gradle build cache (enabled by setting `org.gradle.caching=true` in your gradle.properties file).
* It supports the Gradle configuration cache (enabled by setting `org.gradle.configuration-cache=true` in your gradle.properties file").
* It supports project relocation for the build cache (e.g. you move your project to a new path, or make a new copy/clone of it).
  This is especially useful in a CI context, where you might clone PRs and/or branches for a repository in their own locations.
  Note, however, that there is an issue in an Apache library called `org.apache.ws.xmlschema:xmlschema-core` that might break this - see below for details.
* It supports parallel execution (enabled with `org.gradle.parallel=true` in your gradle.properties file), though it does not itself run anything in parallel.

## Configuration

Apply the plugin ID "com.github.bjornvester.wsdl2java" as specific in the [Gradle Plugin portal page](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.github.bjornvester.wsdl2java), e.g. like this:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.github.bjornvester.wsdl2java") version "2.0.2"
}
```

Put your WSDL and referenced XSD files somewhere in your src/main/resource directory.
By default, the plugin will create Java classes for all the WSDL files in the resource directory.

The generated code will by default end up in the directory build/generated/sources/wsdl2java folder.

You can configure the plugin using the "wsdl2java" extension like this:

```kotlin
wsdl2java {
    // Set properties here...
}
``` 

Here is a list of all available properties:

| Property                   | Type                  | Default                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

These includes `jakarta.xml.ws:jakarta.xml.ws-api`, `jakarta.jws:jakarta.jws-api` and possibly `jakarta.annotation:jakarta.annotation-api`. |

### Configure the CXF version

You can specify the version of CXF used for code generation like this:

```kotlin
wsdl2java {
    cxfVersion.set("4.0.2")
}
```

### Configure included WSDL files

By default, the plugin will find all WSDL files in the `wsdlDir` directory, which defaults to `src/main/resources`.
It is important that if you change this, you change it to a folder that contain all resources (e.g. both WSDL and XSDs).
Otherwise, if you make changes to files outside this folder, Gradle will not see them and thus might consider the task
up-to-date.

The plugin will set the `wsdlLocation` property of the `@WebServiceClient` to the path for the WSDL file relative to
the `wsdlDir` directory.
If you change `wsdlDir` in a way where this no longer makes sense, you need to set the option yourself.
If you have multiple WSDL files, see the section on additional options.

If you have multiple WSDL files and want to only run the tool on some of them, you can use the `includes` property.
Example:

```kotlin
// Only if different from the default 'src/main/resources'
wsdlDir.set(layout.projectDirectory.dir("src/main/wsdl"))

// For Kotlin DSL
includes.set(
    listOf(
        "src/main/wsdls/MyFirstService.wsdl",
        "src/main/wsdls/MySecondService.wsdl"
    )
)
```

```groovy
// For Groovy DSL
includes = [
        "src/main/wsdls/MyFirstService.wsdl",
        "src/main/wsdls/MySecondService.wsdl"
]
```

### Configure additional options

Besides the options given in the `wsdl2java` extension, you can provide additional options directly to CXF (and XJC)
through the `options` property:

```kotlin
// For Kotlin DSL
includes.set(
    listOf(
        "xjc-no-header",
        "xjc-npa"
    )
)

// For Groovy DSL
includes = [
    "xjc-no-header",
    "xjc-npa"
]
```

See [here](https://cxf.apache.org/docs/wsdl-to-java.html) for the available options.

#### Configure additional options for individual WSDL files

It is possible to pass options for individual WSDL files.
This is important especially if you need to explicitly configure the `wsdlLocation` option, as it doesn't make to have
the same location in all files.
(But note that if you leave it out, the plugin will guess it based on the file location.)

```kotlin
// For Kotlin DSL
includesWithOptions.set(
    mapOf(
        "**/ServiceA.wsdl" to listOf("-wsdlLocation", "https://example.com/service-a?wsdl"),
        "**/ServiceB.wsdl" to listOf("-wsdlLocation", "https://example.com/service-b?wsdl")
    )
)
```

```groovy
// For Groovy DSL
includes = [
        "**/ServiceA.wsdl": ["-wsdlLocation", "https://example.com/service-a?wsdl"],
        "**/ServiceB.wsdl": ["-wsdlLocation", "https://example.com/service-b?wsdl"]
]
```

### Configure the output directory

You can optionally specify the directory for the generated source through the `generatedSourceDir` property, which
defaults to `$buildDir/generated/sources/wsdl2java/java`.
Example:

```kotlin
wsdl2java {
    generatedSourceDir.set(layout.projectDirectory.dir("src/generated/wsdl2java"))
}
```

Note that the directory will be wiped completely on each run, so don't put other source files in it.

### Configure binding files

A binding file can be added like this, multiple binding files are supported:

```kotlin
wsdl2java {
    bindingFile("src/main/bindings/binding.xjb")
    bindingFile("src/main/bindings/another-binding.xjb")
}
```

If you get a warning on maximum enum member size, you can raise the maximum like this:

```xml

<jxb:bindings xmlns:jxb="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jaxb"
              jaxb:version="3.0">

    <!-- Raise theEnumMemberSizeCap limit -->
    <jxb:bindings>
        <jxb:globalBindings typesafeEnumMaxMembers="2000"/>
    </jxb:bindings>

</jxb:bindings>
```

If you are using the older `javax` namespace instead of `jakarta`, set the `jxb` attribute to `http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/jaxb` instead and the version to 2.1.

If you like to use the Java Date/Time API instead of the more clunky GregorianCalendar class, you can
use [threeten-jaxb](https://github.com/threeten-jaxb/threeten-jaxb) library with a binding file like example below.

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.threeten-jaxb:threeten-jaxb-core:2.1.0")
}

wsdl2java {
    bindingFile("src/main/bindings/bindings.xjb")
}
```

```xml

<bindings xmlns="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jaxb"
          xmlns:xjc="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/jaxb/xjc"
          version="3.0"
          extensionBindingPrefixes="xjc">
  <globalBindings>
    <xjc:javaType name="java.time.LocalDate" xmlType="xs:date" adapter="io.github.threetenjaxb.core.LocalDateXmlAdapter"/>
    <xjc:javaType name="java.time.LocalDateTime" xmlType="xs:dateTime" adapter="io.github.threetenjaxb.core.LocalDateTimeXmlAdapter"/>
    <xjc:javaType name="java.time.YearMonth" xmlType="xs:gYearMonth" adapter="io.github.threetenjaxb.core.YearMonthXmlAdapter"/>
    <xjc:javaType name="java.time.Duration" xmlType="xs:duration" adapter="io.github.threetenjaxb.core.DurationXmlAdapter"/>
    <xjc:javaType name="java.time.OffsetDate" xmlType="xs:date" adapter="io.github.threetenjaxb.core.OffsetTimeXmlAdapter"/>
    <xjc:javaType name="java.time.OffsetDateTime" xmlType="xs:dateTime" adapter="io.github.threetenjaxb.core.OffsetDateTimeXmlAdapter"/>
  </globalBindings>
</bindings>
```

In the above, for `javax`, use version 1.2.0 and the binding attributes to `xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/jaxb" version="2.1"`.

Note that at the moment, it is not possible to specify more than one binding file in the extension. If you require this,
use the `-b` option.

### Configuring package names

The package name for the generated resources can be configured with the `packageName` field:

```kotlin
wsdl2java {
    packageName.set("com.github.bjornvester.wsdl2java.group1")
}

```

### Configure encoding

If your WSDL files include non-ANSI characters, you should set the corresponding file encoding in your gradle.properties
file. E.g.:

```properties
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8
```

If you are on a POSIX operating system (e.g. Linux), you may in addition to this need to set your operating system
locale to one that supports your encoding.
Otherwise, Java (and therefore also Gradle and CXF) may not be able to create files with names outside of what your
default locale supports.
Especially some Docker images, like the Java ECR images from AWS, are by default set to a locale supporting ASCII only.
If this is the case for you, and you want to use UTF-8, you could export an environment variable like this:

```shell script
export LANG=C.UTF-8
```

### Using javax instead of the jakarta namespace

To use the older javax namespace in the generated files, set the `useJakarta` property to `false.

```kotlin
wsdl2java {
    useJakarta.set(false)
}
```

### Activating (third party) XJC plugins

To use third party plugins for the underlying XJC tool, supply the relevant dependencies to the `xjcPlugins`
configuration.
Then set the plugin options through the `options` property.

For example, to use the "Equals" and "Hashcode" plugin from
the [JAXB2 Basics](https://github.com/highsource/jaxb2-basics) project, configure the following:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // For CXF 3 and javax only (does not work with CXF 4 and jakarta):
    implementation("org.jvnet.jaxb2_commons:jaxb2-basics-runtime:0.13.1")
    xjcPlugins("org.jvnet.jaxb2_commons:jaxb2-basics:0.13.1")
}

wsdl2java {
    options.addAll("-xjc-Xequals", "-xjc-XhashCode")
}
```

Note that the example above is for CXF 3 and the older `javax` namespace.
There is a fork [here](https://github.com/patrodyne/hisrc-basicjaxb) that you may try for CXF 4 and the `jakarta` namespace.

### Enabling the use of the @Generated annotation

CXF (and the underlying XJC tool) can add a `@Generated` annotation to the generated source code.
This is a source annotation useful for marking classes as generated by a tool.
It can also be used by some static code analytic tools to skip these classes.
You can set it by the `markGenerated` configuration:

```kotlin
wsdl2java {
    markGenerated.set(true)
}
```

While very useful in theory, there are some gotchas with this annotation.
One is that it is a source code annotation and thus won't work with tools that work with byte code (like JaCoCo).
Another is that here are actually three `@Generated` annotations.

* The first is `javax.annotation.Generated` and is available in the JDK up til and including Java 8. It is also included in the `javax.annotation:javax.annotation-api` dependency.
* The second is `javax.annotation.processing.Generated` and is available in the JDK from Java 9.
* the third is `jakarta.annotation.Generated` and is included in the `jakarta.annotation:jakarta.annotation-api` dependency.

XJC 3 uses the first, and XJC 4+ uses the third.

Because your tools may only support a particular version of the `@Generated` annotation, you can select which one through the `generatedStyle` configuration.
Supported values are: `default`, `jdk8`, `jdk9` and `jakarta`.
Example:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // The dependency below is only needed if using the Java 8 version of @Generated (through "jdk8") on Java 9 or later
    implementation("javax.annotation:javax.annotation-api:1.3.2")
}

wsdl2java {
    markGenerated.set("jdk8")
}
```

The plugin will also, by default, strip any timestamps from the `@Generated` annotations.
This is to support reproducible builds and the Gradle cache.
This can be disabled by the `suppressGeneratedDate` configuration:

```kotlin
wsdl2java {
    suppressGeneratedDate.set(false)
}
```

## Groups
If the `includesWithOptions` is not enough, you can also make groups of WSDL files, each having their own extension.
This is done like this:

```kotlin
wsdl2java {
    groups {
        register("group1") {
            includes.set(listOf("**/HelloWorldAService.wsdl"))
            options.set(listOf("-wsdlLocation", "MyLocationA"))
            packageName.set("com.github.bjornvester.wsdl2java.group1")
        }
        register("group2") {
            includes.set(listOf("**/HelloWorldBService.wsdl"))
            options.set(listOf("-wsdlLocation", "MyLocationB"))
            packageName.set("com.github.bjornvester.wsdl2java.group2")
        }
    }
}
```

In order to avoid generating resources with the same name but different content (for instance like the generated `ObjectFactory` class), you should make sure each group use its own package name.

## Other

The plugin will add the following two dependencies to your `implementation` configuration:

```
jakarta.xml.ws:jakarta.xml.ws-api:2.3.3
jakarta.jws:jakarta.jws-api:1.1.1
```

These are required to compile the generated code.
However, depending on your runtime platform, you may want to exclude them and instead either put them in the `compileOnly` configuration, or use whatever libraries that are
provided by the platform.

There are full examples available in the integration-test directory.

If you need to compile additional XML schemas (xsd files) not directly referenced by the wsdl files, you can use
the [com.github.bjornvester.xjc](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.github.bjornvester.xjc) plugin in addition.

## Limitations

### CXF does not check for unique names in generated resources

The CXF tool will overwrite generated classes from multiple WSDL files if they have the same qualified name.
Especially the `ObjectFactory` class might be overwritten, which is very annoying.

### CXF is not deterministic

When CXF generates an `ObjectFactory` class, the order of the methods are not deterministic, but depend on the absolute path of the input files.
This may cause misses in the Gradle build cache, ecp, which may propagate to downstream projects, resulting in long build times.
I have a local fix for this and I hope to create a PR for it to the relevant Apache project.

## Contributions

I often feel a bit stretched out in terms of maintaining this and my other projects.
For that reason, I might not respond to issues and PRs very often.
